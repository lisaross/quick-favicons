# Quick Favicons

This is a super simple webpack runner that creates all required favicons for a project and zips it up.

Best case scenario, you'd just build the webpack favicon plugin into a larger project, but I had some use cases where I just needed a zip file of my favicon/s to send to a 3rd party.

This repository contains:

1. yarn.lock file to install dependencies ([zip-webpack-plugin](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/zip-webpack-plugin), [webpack-cli](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/webpack-cli), [webpack](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/webpack), [html-webpack-plugin](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/html-webpack-plugin), [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/favicons-webpack-plugin))
2. simple webpack.config.js file for you to customize as needed
3. standard .gitignore
4. blank index.js (not needed)
5. src directory with dummy favicon

Replace src/favicon.png with your logo

Modify webpack.config.js with options (title, background, etc -- see https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin for plugin usage)

...
    title: 'Project Name',
    background: "#000",
    icons: {
        android: true,
        appleIcon: true,
        appleStartup: true,
        coast: false,
        favicons: true,
        firefox: true,
        opengraph: false,
        twitter: false,
        yandex: false,
        windows: false
    }
...
```
